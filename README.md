standard disclaimer.

This is for educational purposes / testing only.
It has been made in order to demonstrate how a terminal
session can be tampered with and to provide insight
into the inner workings of terminal sessions so that
this can be acknowledged as a security issue that
should be considered and mitigated against where 
possible, this has been developed in a test lab environment
and I advise you to also only use this in a test environment
that you have permission to use.


Only use this when and where you are authorized to do so.
I am not responsible for how you use this and
I believe it will only be used in situations where it has been approved.
