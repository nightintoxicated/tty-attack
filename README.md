disclaimer.

This is for educational purposes and defensive 
measures on your own hardware / hardware you have permission to use.
I will not be held responsible if you do anything stupid with it.

It has been made as a tool for defense and 
in order to demonstrate how a terminal
session can be tampered with, it will also provide insight
into the inner workings of terminal sessions so that
this can be acknowledged as a security issue that
should be considered and mitigated against where 
possible, this has been developed in a test lab environment
and should only be used this in an environment
that you have permission to use.


Only use this when and where you are authorized to do so.
I am not responsible for how you use this and
I believe it will only be used in situations where it has been approved.
